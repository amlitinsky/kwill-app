First refer to my PRD document and consider minimalistic design principles, UI/UX and meeting. then, Refer to the following image. 
First, is displaying meetings as a list like this a good idea, or is there a better approach? Additionally, for each meeting, it should display relevant and useful information to the user. Also, if we have created a new meeting, we should have some form of the following, some toasts that will pop up to remind user of the status of their latest meeting, second, if the meeting information is processing there should be nice loading animations for the row for that specific meeting, once the meeting has fully processed, there should be a success green status symbol maybe, up for your creativity. Also, if the meeting has processed, users should be able to click that specific meeting (basically anywhere in that entire row), and it will direct them to a new page with that specific meeting content. Now, here's where you need to get creative and maybe analyze my codebase, and what information we're gathering. I basically want a mini AI summary insights based, as well as some metrics or analytics collected in the meeting. There should be a way to view the meeting transcript, and the meeting summary, and the meeting insights based on the LLM's analysis as well as the meeting insights based on the user's custom instructions. Regarding storign meeting transcripts, this is tricky, but perhaps we should allow the user to optionally save the transcript on their own system, and we store the transcript on our system for a week and delete it afterwards. We should also include the option for users to edit their custom instructions and then reupload the mapped values to that specific google spreadsheets row (this is also another consideration, overwrite that existing row or add that data to a new row?) Just for your reference, I've attached the image of the meeting list. And these are the files that I've used for the meeting pipeline: ~/src/app/meetings/page.tsx ~/src/app/api/webhook/route.ts ~/src/lib/supabase-server.ts (fyi I'm not sure this is all of them so please search and find the appropiate files)
