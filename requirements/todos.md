# TODOS
- change starting entry, maybe we should say something like link a spreadsheet paste a meeting link for relatively easy onboarding
- make the input dialog exactly the same size as for existing chats
- for naming chat, we should probably generate a name for it and then somehow client refteches it
- Continue testing tool functionality and experimenting with different models




# ETC
1. Implement dark mode effectively (we are using text white for the text and standard color for now (which ig is fine for now?))
2. Change loading state colors and size
3. Initial chat state include loading icon and proper placeholder (also proper placeholder for chat input in relevance to niche)
4. Streaming out meeting insights
