Design Document: Kwill - Core Functionality MVP (2025-02-08)
This document outlines the design for the core functionality of Kwill Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

1. Overall Architecture (MVP)

+---------------------+      +---------------------+      +---------------------+
|   Frontend (Client)   | <--> |     Backend (API)     | <--> |  Integrations & LLM  |
|  (Next.js 15,       |      |  (tRPC, Next.js API  |      |  (Recall.ai,        |
|   shadcn/ui,         |      |   Drizzle ORM,       |      |   Google Sheets API, |
|   Next.js AI SDK)    |      |   Neon Postgres)        |      |   Gemini Pro)        |
+---------------------+      +---------------------+      +---------------------+
         ^                                ^                                ^
         | User Interaction               | API, Orchestration, Data      | AI Processing & Data Sources
         |                                | Logic, Database               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                             Data Storage (Neon Postgres)                       |
|                 (Spreadsheets, Meetings, Chat History)                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2. Database Design (Drizzle ORM - MVP)


(As described in detail in the code comments within the sendMessage function above.)

5. LLM Selection (MVP)

Google Gemini Pro remains the recommended LLM for its integration with Google ecosystem and structured output capabilities, with prompt engineering as key for optimization.
Also considering DeepSeek, Claude 3, and Llama 3 as alternatives.

6. Frontend (Next.js 15, AI SDK - MVP)

(Frontend design remains as previously described).

7. Authentication and Authorization (Clerk - Simplified MVP)

(Authentication flow simplified by Clerk remains as previously described).

8. Data Flow Walkthrough (Zoom Link Processing - MVP)

(Data flow walkthrough remains conceptually similar to previous description, now aligned with the simplified database and code structure above.)

9. Technology Stack Summary (MVP)

(Technology stack list remains consistent with previous descriptions).

10. Implementation Steps (Core Functionality MVP - Concise)

(Implementation steps remain consistent with the previous concise list, now directly aligned with the simplified and code-centric design document above.)   

This comprehensive and code-integrated Design Document provides a detailed blueprint for implementing the core functionality of Kwill MVP. Let me know if you have any further questions or require any adjustments!   

# Implementation Steps
1. Clerk OAuth
2. Database Design and Integration with Drizzle ORM (make the necessary schema updates)
3. Chat Interface UI 
4. API Routes and Integration with LLM and Groq LPU
5. Recall.ai API Integration
6. Google Sheets API Integration
7. Error Handling and Logging
8. Testing and Validation
