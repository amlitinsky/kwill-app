Let's walk through an end-to-end example to clarify the database interactions and data flow within SheetSync AI. We'll use a scenario of a user processing a Zoom meeting and linking it to a spreadsheet.

**Scenario: Sarah, a VC Analyst, wants to process a Zoom meeting transcript and get action items and a summary added to her Google Sheet.**

**Pre-requisites:**

*   Sarah has signed up for SheetSync AI and is logged in via Clerk.
*   Sarah has linked her Google account to SheetSync AI (via Google OAuth through Clerk).
*   Sarah has a Google Sheet ready, let's say with `googleSheetId = "spreadsheet123"` and columns like "Meeting Date," "Startup Name," "Funding Stage," "Action Items," "Meeting Summary."

**End-to-End Data Flow Example:**

1.  **User Starts Chat & Links Spreadsheet:**
    *   Sarah starts a new chat in the SheetSync AI frontend.
    *   Sarah types: "Link this spreadsheet: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheet123/edit#gid=0`".
    *   Frontend sends a `chat.sendMessage` request to the backend API with the message and Sarah's `clerkId` (let's say `clerkId = "userSarahClerkId"`).

2.  **Backend Processes "Link Spreadsheet" Intent:**
    *   Backend API (`/api/chat/sendMessage`) receives the request.
    *   LLM analyzes the message, identifies the intent as `link_spreadsheet` and extracts `googleSheetId = "spreadsheet123"`.
    *   Backend logic validates `googleSheetId`.
    *   **Database Interaction (Spreadsheets Table - INSERT):**
        *   Backend inserts a new row into the `spreadsheets` table:
            ```sql
            INSERT INTO spreadsheets (clerkId, googleSheetId, name)
            VALUES ('userSarahClerkId', 'spreadsheet123', 'Sarah\'s Deal Flow Sheet');
            ```
            *   Drizzle ORM will handle generating the `id` (serial primary key). Let's assume `id` becomes `spreadsheetId_1`.
    *   Backend sends a chat response back to Sarah: "Spreadsheet linked! I will use this for future meeting updates in this chat."

3.  **User Processes Zoom Meeting:**
    *   Sarah pastes a Zoom meeting link into the chat: "Process this meeting: `https://zoom.us/j/zoomMeeting456`".
    *   Frontend sends another `chat.sendMessage` request with the new message and `clerkId = "userSarahClerkId"`.

4.  **Backend Processes "Process Zoom Meeting" Intent:**
    *   Backend API (`/api/chat/sendMessage`) receives the request.
    *   LLM analyzes the message, identifies the intent as `process_zoom_meeting` and extracts `zoomMeetingLink = "https://zoom.us/j/zoomMeeting456"`.
    *   Backend logic:
        *   **Database Interaction (Meetings Table - INSERT - Initial Record):**
            *   Backend inserts a new row into the `meetings` table to track this meeting processing:
                ```sql
                INSERT INTO meetings (clerkId, spreadsheetId, zoomMeetingLink, processingStatus)
                VALUES ('userSarahClerkId', spreadsheetId_1, 'https://zoom.us/j/zoomMeeting456', 'processing');
                ```
                *   Drizzle ORM generates `id` for the `meetings` table, let's say `meetingId_1`.  `spreadsheetId` is linked to `spreadsheetId_1` (from step 2).  `processingStatus` is set to 'processing'.
        *   **Direct Recall.ai API Call (Synchronous for MVP):** Backend calls Recall.ai API to process `zoomMeetingLink = "https://zoom.us/j/zoomMeeting456"`.
        *   **Recall.ai Processes and Returns Transcript:** Recall.ai processes the meeting and returns the transcript and metadata. Let's assume `recallAiTranscriptId = "transcriptXYZ"`.
        *   **LLM Entity Extraction (Google Gemini Pro):** Backend sends the transcript to Google Gemini Pro with a prompt that includes finance-specific jargon consideration (e.g., instructing the LLM to be aware of terms like "Series A," "valuation," "term sheet," "dilution," etc. in its analysis). The prompt asks for structured JSON output.
        *   **LLM Returns Structured JSON (example):**
            ```json
            {
              "meeting_date": "2025-02-09",
              "startups": ["Acme Corp", "Beta Industries"],
              "funding_stage": "Seed Round",
              "funding_amount": "$500,000",
              "action_items": [
                "Follow up with Acme Corp about term sheet",
                "Schedule demo with Beta Industries next week"
              ],
              "summary": "Meeting discussed potential seed investment in Acme Corp and initial interest in Beta Industries. Next steps are to follow up with Acme on term sheet and schedule a demo with Beta."
            }
            ```
        *   **Google Sheets API Update:** Backend uses Sarah's Google Access Token (retrieved via Clerk) and the linked `googleSheetId = "spreadsheet123"` to update Sarah's Google Sheet. It maps the extracted data to the columns in her sheet (e.g., "Startup Name" -> "Acme Corp, Beta Industries", "Funding Stage" -> "Seed Round", "Action Items" -> "Follow up with Acme Corp..., Schedule demo with Beta...").
        *   **Database Interaction (Meetings Table - UPDATE):**
            *   Backend *updates* the `meetings` table record `meetingId_1`:
                ```sql
                UPDATE meetings
                SET recallAiTranscriptId = 'transcriptXYZ',
                    llmExtractedData = '{
                      "meeting_date": "2025-02-09",
                      "startups": ["Acme Corp", "Beta Industries"],
                      "funding_stage": "Seed Round",
                      "funding_amount": "$500,000",
                      "action_items": [
                        "Follow up with Acme Corp about term sheet",
                        "Schedule demo with Beta Industries next week"
                      ],
                      "summary": "Meeting discussed potential seed investment in Acme Corp and initial interest in Beta Industries. Next steps are to follow up with Acme on term sheet and schedule a demo with Beta."
                    }',
                    processingStatus = 'completed',
                    updatedAt = NOW()
                WHERE id = meetingId_1;
                ```
        *   Backend sends a chat response back to Sarah: "Zoom meeting processed! I've updated your spreadsheet with action items and a summary.  Here are the highlights: ... (summary and action items text)... [Link to your spreadsheet]."

5.  **User Asks About Past Meeting (Chat History):**
    *   Sarah types: "What were the action items from that last meeting again?"
    *   Frontend sends `chat.sendMessage` with the message and `clerkId = "userSarahClerkId"`.

6.  **Backend Responds to Chat Query (Leveraging Chat History and Meeting Data):**
    *   Backend API (`/api/chat/sendMessage`) receives the query.
    *   LLM analyzes the message, understanding it's a follow-up question about the *previous* meeting.
    *   **Database Interaction (ChatMessages Table - SELECT):**
        *   Backend could query the `chatMessages` table to retrieve recent chat history for context (though for MVP, we might keep context simpler).
    *   **Database Interaction (Meetings Table - SELECT):**
        *   Backend *retrieves* the `llmExtractedData` from the `meetings` table for `meetingId_1` (the last processed meeting, context from chat history helps determine this).
        *   Extracts "action_items" from the `llmExtractedData` JSON.
    *   Backend constructs a chat response: "The action items from the last meeting were: 1. Follow up with Acme Corp about term sheet. 2. Schedule demo with Beta Industries next week."
    *   Backend streams the response back to the frontend.

**Role of `chatMessages` Table:**

*   **Storing Conversation History:** The `chatMessages` table records every message in the chat, both user inputs and agent responses.  This provides:
    *   **Context for Follow-up Questions:**  As in step 6, the agent can use chat history to understand user context and answer follow-up queries (even in a basic MVP implementation by considering the *last* user message or a few recent turns).
    *   **Reviewable Chat Log:** Users can scroll back and review the entire conversation history within SheetSync AI.
    *   **Future Features (Conversation Analysis):** In the future, you could analyze chat history for user behavior, feedback, and to improve the agent's performance over time.
*   **Linking to Meetings (Optional):** The `meetingId` column in `chatMessages` allows you to link specific chat messages to a particular meeting processing flow.  This can be useful for:
    *   Grouping chat messages related to a specific meeting for better organization and context.
    *   Potentially triggering actions or providing context based on chat messages *within* a meeting processing workflow (though this is more advanced and likely beyond the MVP). For the MVP, we can start simpler and just store chat history generally linked to the user (`clerkId`) and optionally linked to a meeting.

**Finance Jargon Consideration:**

*   **Prompt Engineering is Key:**  To ensure the LLM (Google Gemini Pro) understands finance jargon, your prompts must be carefully engineered to:
    *   **System Prompt:** In the system prompt, explicitly instruct the LLM that it's operating in the context of "investor meetings," "venture capital," "financial analysis," etc.  Provide examples of investor-specific terms (Series A, valuation, dilution, term sheet, cap table, due diligence, etc.).
    *   **Example Prompts/Few-Shot Learning:**  Consider including a few examples in your prompts (few-shot learning) showing how to extract entities and interpret text in the context of investor meetings.  "For example, if the transcript mentions 'They are raising a Series A,' you should identify 'Series A' as the funding stage."
    *   **Iterative Prompt Refinement:** Expect to iteratively refine your prompts based on testing and observing the LLM's output. Analyze cases where the LLM misinterprets jargon and adjust the prompts to improve its understanding.
    *   **Domain-Specific Data (Future):**  For more advanced performance, consider fine-tuning the LLM on a dataset of investor meeting transcripts and financial documents.  This is a longer-term optimization, not essential for the MVP but valuable for future accuracy.

**Meetings Without Spreadsheet ID:**

*   If Sarah had processed the Zoom meeting *without* first linking a spreadsheet, the flow would be similar, but:
    *   In step 2 (link spreadsheet), that step would be skipped.
    *   In step 4 (process zoom meeting), when inserting into the `meetings` table, the `spreadsheetId` would be `NULL`.
    *   Google Sheets API update step would be skipped.
    *   The chat response would *only* include the AI-generated summaries and action items in text format within the chat, *without* updating any spreadsheet.
    *   SheetSync AI would still process the meeting and provide value by summarizing and extracting key data points, even if the user doesn't want to export it to a spreadsheet.

**Summary of Database Role:**

The database is central to SheetSync AI. It's used to:

*   **Persistent Data Storage:** Store user spreadsheet links, meeting processing history, chat history, and structured data extracted by the LLM.
*   **State Management:** Track the processing status of meetings (`processingStatus`).
*   **Context and Relationships:**  Link users to spreadsheets and meetings using `clerkId`, and optionally link chat messages to meetings.
*   **Data Retrieval for Agent Responses:**  Enable the agent to retrieve information from past meetings and chat history to answer user queries and provide contextually relevant responses.

This detailed example and explanation should hopefully clarify how the database schema and architecture support the core functionalities of SheetSync AI and how data flows through the system during a typical user interaction. Let me know if you have any further questions!
